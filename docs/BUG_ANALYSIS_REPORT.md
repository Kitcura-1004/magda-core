# Bug Analysis Report - magda-core

## Summary
This report documents potential bugs found during a systematic analysis of the magda-core codebase, focusing on audio/threading code and memory management patterns.

## Bugs Found

### Bug #1: Array Bounds Violation in MIDI Activity Tracking (CRITICAL ⚠️)

**Severity**: HIGH - Silent failure, could cause confusion for users
**Confidence**: 100% - This is a definite bug

**Location**:
- `magda/daw/audio/AudioBridge.hpp` lines 534-535
- `magda/daw/audio/AudioBridge.cpp` lines 1013-1024

**Description**:
The `AudioBridge` class has a fixed-size array `midiActivityFlags_` with 128 entries (`kMaxTracks = 128`). However, track IDs in `TrackManager` are generated using an auto-incrementing `nextTrackId_` that can grow beyond 128. When track IDs exceed 128, calls to `triggerMidiActivity()` and `consumeMidiActivity()` will silently fail due to bounds checking.

**Code**:
```cpp
// AudioBridge.hpp:534-535
static constexpr int kMaxTracks = 128;
std::array<std::atomic<bool>, kMaxTracks> midiActivityFlags_;

// AudioBridge.cpp:1013-1017
void AudioBridge::triggerMidiActivity(TrackId trackId) {
    if (trackId >= 0 && trackId < kMaxTracks) {
        midiActivityFlags_[trackId].store(true, std::memory_order_release);
    }
}
```

**Reproduction Scenario**:
1. User creates 100 tracks (IDs 1-100)
2. Deletes 90 tracks (but IDs are not reused)
3. Creates 50 more tracks (IDs 101-150)
4. Track 150 exists but MIDI activity indicator doesn't work

**Impact**:
- MIDI activity indicators fail for tracks with IDs >= 128
- Silent failure - no error message or warning
- Confusing user experience (feature appears broken for some tracks)

**Suggested Fix**:
Replace fixed-size array with dynamic container:
```cpp
// Option 1: Use unordered_map
std::unordered_map<TrackId, std::atomic<bool>> midiActivityFlags_;

// Option 2: Use map for ordered access
std::map<TrackId, std::atomic<bool>> midiActivityFlags_;
```

**Test Case**: `tests/test_audiobridge_track_limit_bug.cpp`

### Bug #2: Plugin Cleanup Ordering Issue (LOW severity, MEDIUM risk ⚠️)

**Severity**: LOW - Currently works but fragile
**Confidence**: 80% - Pattern is fragile and risky

**Location**:
- `magda/daw/audio/AudioBridge.cpp` around line 917 in `syncTrackPlugins()`

**Description**:
When removing plugins that no longer exist, there's a subtle ordering issue with bidirectional map cleanup. The code uses `plugin.get()` to get a raw pointer as a map key, but the order of operations is fragile.

**Code**:
```cpp
// Current code (fragile but works):
auto plugin = it->second;
pluginToDevice_.erase(plugin.get());  // Using raw pointer from plugin.get()
deviceToPlugin_.erase(it);
plugin->deleteFromParent();
```

**Issue**:
While currently safe (because `plugin` holds a reference), if refactored to not use the local variable, it becomes a use-after-free:

```cpp
// Hypothetical broken refactoring:
pluginToDevice_.erase(it->second.get());  // BAD: Could use dangling pointer
deviceToPlugin_.erase(it);
it->second->deleteFromParent();
```

**Impact**:
- Currently: No impact, works correctly
- If refactored: Potential crash or memory corruption
- Hard to debug if it breaks
- May only manifest under specific timing conditions

**Suggested Fix**:
Make the ordering more explicit and safe:

**Option 1: Store raw pointer first**
```cpp
auto plugin = it->second;
auto* pluginPtr = plugin.get();  // Store raw pointer explicitly
pluginToDevice_.erase(pluginPtr);
deviceToPlugin_.erase(it);
plugin->deleteFromParent();
```

**Option 2: Erase from deviceToPlugin_ first**
```cpp
auto plugin = it->second;
deviceToPlugin_.erase(it);  // Erase from ownership map first
pluginToDevice_.erase(plugin.get());  // Now safe to use get()
plugin->deleteFromParent();
```

**Test Case**: `tests/test_audiobridge_plugin_cleanup_bug.cpp`

### Bug #3: Potential Iterator Invalidation in ClipManager (MEDIUM severity ⚠️)

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Could cause crashes if misused
**Confidence**: 90% - Design issue, currently safe but risky

**Location**:
- `magda/daw/core/ClipManager.cpp` lines 392-404 (`getClip`)

**Description**:
The `getClip()` function returns a raw pointer to an element in a `std::vector<ClipInfo>`. If the vector is modified (via `deleteClip()`, `createClip()`, or any operation that causes reallocation), all pointers returned by `getClip()` become dangling.

**Code**:
```cpp
ClipInfo* ClipManager::getClip(ClipId clipId) {
    auto it = std::find_if(clips_.begin(), clips_.end(),
                           [clipId](const ClipInfo& c) { return c.id == clipId; });
    return (it != clips_.end()) ? &(*it) : nullptr;  // Returns pointer to vector element
}

void ClipManager::deleteClip(ClipId clipId) {
    // ...
    clips_.erase(it);  // Invalidates all pointers to vector elements!
    notifyClipsChanged();
}
```

**Dangerous Pattern**:
```cpp
auto* clip1 = getClip(1);  // Get pointer to clip 1
auto* clip2 = getClip(2);  // Get pointer to clip 2

// Now do something that triggers vector reallocation:
createClip(...);  // Vector might reallocate

// clip1 and clip2 are now dangling pointers! ❌
clip1->name = "foo";  // Crash or memory corruption
```

**Current Status**:
- Currently SAFE: All current usage gets the pointer and uses it immediately
- No code holds pointers across function calls
- But design is fragile and easy to misuse

**Impact**:
- Current: No known issues
- Future: Easy to introduce bugs if pattern is not understood
- Could cause crashes, memory corruption, or data corruption
- Hard to debug (symptoms appear far from root cause)

**Suggested Fix**:

**Option 1: Document the limitation** (minimal change)
```cpp
/**
 * @brief Get a pointer to a clip (TEMPORARY USE ONLY)
 *
 * WARNING: The returned pointer is invalidated by ANY operation that
 * modifies clips_ (create, delete, or any operation causing reallocation).
 * Do NOT store this pointer. Use immediately and discard.
 *
 * @return Pointer to clip, valid only until next clips_ modification
 */
ClipInfo* getClip(ClipId clipId);
```

**Option 2: Return by value** (safer but more copying)
```cpp
std::optional<ClipInfo> getClip(ClipId clipId) const;
```

**Option 3: Use stable container** (more memory overhead)
```cpp
// Change clips_ from vector to map:
std::map<ClipId, ClipInfo> clips_;
// or use deque for stable pointers:
std::deque<ClipInfo> clips_;
```

**Recommendation**: Add documentation warning (Option 1) in the short term. Consider changing container (Option 3) if performance allows.

## Additional Observations

### Positive Patterns Found ✅

1. **Good use of atomics**: Transport state and MIDI activity use proper atomic operations with appropriate memory ordering
2. **Proper shutdown handling**: `isShuttingDown_` flags prevent operations during cleanup
3. **Lock management**: Timer callbacks properly hold locks while accessing shared data
4. **JUCE CriticalSection**: Correctly used (and is recursive, so nested locks are safe)

### Areas of Concern (Not Bugs, But Risky) ⚠️

1. **Raw pointer storage in maps**: `trackMapping_` stores raw `AudioTrack*` pointers
   - Currently safe because Tracktion Engine owns the tracks
   - Fragile if ownership changes

2. **Callback-driven architecture**: Many listener callbacks could trigger reentrant code
   - Need to be careful about holding locks when calling listeners
   - Could lead to deadlocks if not careful

3. **Manual dynamic_cast usage**: Many places use `dynamic_cast` without null checks
   - Currently appears safe but should verify all cases

## Testing

Created test files:
- `tests/test_audiobridge_track_limit_bug.cpp` - Documents Bug #1 with reproduction steps
- `tests/test_audiobridge_plugin_cleanup_bug.cpp` - Documents Bug #2 with best practices

These are documentation tests that compile and explain the bugs. Full integration tests would require the complete Tracktion Engine setup.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. ✅ **Fix Bug #1**: Replace fixed-size array with dynamic container
   - Impact: Fixes real user-visible bug
   - Risk: Low (straightforward fix)

### Short Term (Medium Priority)
2. **Review Bug #3**: Add documentation warnings to `getClip()`
   - Impact: Prevents future bugs
   - Risk: Minimal (documentation only)

3. **Consider Bug #2**: Improve plugin cleanup ordering
   - Impact: Makes code more maintainable
   - Risk: Low (minor refactoring)

### Long Term (Low Priority)
4. **Code Review**: Review all `dynamic_cast` usage for proper null checks
5. **Architecture Review**: Consider moving away from raw pointers in maps
6. **Testing**: Add more integration tests for edge cases
