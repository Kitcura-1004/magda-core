# MAGDA - Project Vision & Feature Requirements

## Project Overview
MAGDA is a **Multi-Agent Generative Interface for Creative Audio** - a DAW that combines traditional audio production with AI-driven multi-agent collaboration. Beyond the multi-agent framework we've discussed, here are the core DAW features and design principles.

## Core DAW Features

### 1. Hybrid Track System
**Concept**: No distinction between audio and MIDI tracks (like Reaper/Bitwig hybrid tracks)

**Requirements**:
- Single track type that can contain both audio and MIDI clips
- Seamless workflow between MIDI and audio content
- Plugin chains work identically for both content types
- Track routing and processing unified

**Benefits**:
- Simplified workflow
- More flexible arrangements
- Easier collaboration between different content types

### 2. Advanced Bounce-in-Place System
**Concept**: Freeze MIDI to audio while retaining full editing capability

**Core Features**:
- **Bounce with Plugin Chain Retention**: When bouncing MIDI to audio, keep the original plugin chain active
- **Layered Processing**: Audio result can still be processed through the same effects chain
- **Reversible Operations**: Always able to return to MIDI source

**Advanced Features**:
- **Super Undo History**: Complete history of all bounce operations on a track
- **Track State Timeline**: Visual representation of track evolution (MIDI → Audio → Re-MIDI → etc.)
- **Version Management**: Multiple versions of track states accessible
- **Non-destructive Workflow**: Original MIDI always preserved

**Implementation Notes**:
- Track history stored as state snapshots
- Each bounce operation creates new history node
- Plugin chain states also versioned
- Background processing for large bounce operations

### 3. User Interface Design

#### Layout Philosophy
**Inspiration**: Ableton Live / Bitwig Studio hybrid approach

**Main Layout**:
- **Top**: Track headers and mixer controls
- **Middle**: Main timeline/arrangement view
- **Bottom**: Context-sensitive detail panel

#### Bottom Panel System
**Dynamic Content Based on Selection**:
- **Track Content View**: When track selected, show clips, automation, etc.
- **Plugin Chain View**: When plugin selected, show full effects chain with parameters
- **DSP Script View**: When DSP processor selected, show code editor and parameters
- **Agent Prompt Space**: Dedicated tab for multi-agent interaction and conversation
- **Seamless Switching**: Quick toggle between content, plugin, script, and prompt views

#### Track Containers
**Concept**: Hierarchical track organization like Ableton/Bitwig groups

**1. Native to DAWproject Export**
```cpp
class DAWprojectExporter {
public:
    // Export full project
    bool exportProject(const MAGDAProject& project,
                      const std::string& outputPath);

    // Export selected tracks
    bool exportTracks(const std::vector<Track>& tracks,
                     const std::string& outputPath);

    // Export options
    struct ExportOptions {
        bool includePluginStates = true;
        bool includeAutomation = true;
        bool bounceToAudio = false;
        AudioFormat audioFormat = AudioFormat::WAV_48kHz_24bit;
    };
};
```

**2. Agent-Enhanced Export**

#### CLAP Plugin Format Support & Implementation Strategy

**CLAP Overview**:
- **Modern Standard**: Open-source plugin format designed for modern DAWs
- **Performance**: Lower latency, better threading, more efficient than VST
- **Future-Proof**: Designed with modern audio processing in mind
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Increasing adoption by major plugin developers

**Current Status & Challenge**:
- **Tracktion Engine**: Limited CLAP support (JUCE-based, older plugin architecture)
- **JUCE**: Basic CLAP hosting support available but not fully integrated
- **Migration Path**: Need custom CLAP implementation for full support

**Implementation Strategy**:

**Phase 1: JUCE-Based CLAP Support (Current)**
```cpp
// Leverage JUCE's existing CLAP support
class JUCEPluginManager {
private:
    juce::AudioPluginFormatManager formatManager_;
    std::unique_ptr<juce::CLAPPluginFormat> clapFormat_;

public:
    bool initializeCLAPSupport() {
        clapFormat_ = std::make_unique<juce::CLAPPluginFormat>();
        formatManager_.addFormat(clapFormat_.get());
        return true;
    }

    std::vector<juce::PluginDescription> scanCLAPPlugins() {
        return clapFormat_->findAllTypes();
    }
};
```

**Phase 2: Custom CLAP Host Implementation**
```cpp
// Direct CLAP hosting for maximum performance
class CLAPHost {
private:
    clap_host_t host_;
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<CLAPPlugin>> plugins_;

public:
    // CLAP host callbacks
    static const clap_host_t* getCLAPHost() {
        static clap_host_t host = {
            .clap_version = CLAP_VERSION,
            .host_data = nullptr,
            .name = "MAGDA",
            .vendor = "MAGDA",
            .url = "https://magda-daw.com",
            .version = MAGICA_VERSION,
            .get_extension = getExtension,
            .request_restart = requestRestart,
            .request_process = requestProcess,
            .request_callback = requestCallback
        };
        return &host;
    }

    // Plugin management
    bool loadCLAPPlugin(const std::string& path);
    void unloadCLAPPlugin(const std::string& pluginId);
    std::vector<CLAPParameter> getPluginParameters(const std::string& pluginId);
};
```

**Phase 3: Unified Plugin Interface**
```cpp
// Abstract plugin interface supporting all formats
class PluginInterface {
public:
    virtual ~PluginInterface() = default;

    // Common plugin operations
    virtual bool initialize(const AudioConfig& config) = 0;
    virtual void processAudio(AudioBuffer& buffer) = 0;
    virtual void shutdown() = 0;

    // Parameter management
    virtual std::vector<Parameter> getParameters() const = 0;
    virtual void setParameter(const std::string& id, double value) = 0;
    virtual double getParameter(const std::string& id) const = 0;

    // State management
    virtual void saveState(std::vector<uint8_t>& data) = 0;
    virtual void loadState(const std::vector<uint8_t>& data) = 0;

    // Plugin info
    virtual std::string getName() const = 0;
    virtual std::string getVendor() const = 0;
    virtual PluginType getType() const = 0;
};

// Format-specific implementations
class CLAPPlugin : public PluginInterface {
private:
    const clap_plugin_t* plugin_;
    clap_plugin_params_t* params_;
    clap_plugin_state_t* state_;

public:
    // CLAP-specific implementation
    bool initialize(const AudioConfig& config) override;
    void processAudio(AudioBuffer& buffer) override;
    // ... other implementations
};

class VST3Plugin : public PluginInterface {
    // VST3-specific implementation
};

class AUPlugin : public PluginInterface {
    // AU-specific implementation
};
```

**Plugin Discovery & Management**:

**1. Multi-Format Scanner**
```cpp
class PluginScanner {

    struct PluginInfo {
        std::string name;
        std::string vendor;
        std::string path;
        PluginFormat format; // CLAP, VST3, AU, LV2
        PluginType type;     // Effect, Instrument, etc.
        std::string version;
        bool is64bit;
        bool isValid;
    };

    std::vector<PluginInfo> scanAllFormats() {
        std::vector<PluginInfo> allPlugins;

        // Scan CLAP plugins
        auto clapPlugins = scanCLAPPlugins();
        allPlugins.insert(allPlugins.end(), clapPlugins.begin(), clapPlugins.end());

        // Scan VST3 plugins
        auto vst3Plugins = scanVST3Plugins();
        allPlugins.insert(allPlugins.end(), vst3Plugins.begin(), vst3Plugins.end());

        // Scan AU plugins (macOS only)
        #ifdef JUCE_MAC
        auto auPlugins = scanAUPlugins();
        allPlugins.insert(allPlugins.end(), auPlugins.begin(), auPlugins.end());
        #endif

        return allPlugins;
    }

private:
    std::vector<PluginInfo> scanCLAPPlugins();
    std::vector<PluginInfo> scanVST3Plugins();
    std::vector<PluginInfo> scanAUPlugins();
};
```

**2. Plugin Compatibility Matrix**
```cpp
struct PluginCompatibility {
    std::string pluginId;
    std::vector<PluginFormat> supportedFormats;
    std::map<PluginFormat, std::string> formatPaths;
    bool hasCLAP;
    bool hasVST3;
    bool hasAU;
    bool hasLV2;

    // Performance metrics

public:
    enum class ExpressionType {
        Volume,
        Pan,
        Tuning,
        Vibrato,
        Expression,
        Brightness,
        Pressure
    };

    struct NoteExpression {
        int32_t noteId;
        int16_t portIndex;
        int16_t channel;
        int16_t key;
        ExpressionType type;
        double value;
    };

    void processNoteExpressions(const std::vector<NoteExpression>& expressions);
};
```

**2. Polyphonic Modulation**
```cpp
// CLAP's polyphonic modulation system
class CLAPPolyphonicModulation {
public:
    struct ModulationTarget {
        int32_t noteId;
        int16_t portIndex;
        int16_t channel;
        int16_t key;
        int32_t paramId;
        double value;
    };

    void processPolyphonicModulation(const std::vector<ModulationTarget>& targets);
};
```

**3. Transport Sync**
```cpp
// CLAP's transport synchronization

#### Multi-Agent Threading & Process Architecture

**Concept**: Complete isolation of AI agents from real-time audio processing

**Critical Requirements**:
- **Zero Audio Interference**: Agent processing must never affect audio thread performance
- **Real-time Priority Protection**: Audio thread gets highest priority, agents run at lower priority
- **Resource Isolation**: Agents can use intensive CPU/GPU without impacting audio
- **Scalable Processing**: Agent framework can utilize multiple cores/machines

**Threading Architecture**:
```
Real-time Audio Thread (Highest Priority)
├── Audio processing only
├── No memory allocation
├── No disk I/O
├── No network operations
└── Lock-free communication with other threads

UI Thread (High Priority)
├── User interface rendering
├── User input handling
├── Quick UI updates
└── Message passing to agent threads

Agent Framework Process/Thread Pool (Normal Priority)
├── Multi-Agent Orchestrator
├── DSP Agent (CPU intensive)
├── Sample Organization Agent (I/O intensive)

├── Mixing Agent (analysis & DSP)
└── Utility Agent (file operations)

Background Services (Low Priority)
├── Sample library scanning
├── ML model training
├── Project backup/sync
└── System maintenance
```

**Inter-Process Communication**:
- **Lock-free Queues**: Audio thread → Agent framework (commands)
- **Callback System**: Agent framework → Audio thread (results)
- **Shared Memory**: Large data transfer (audio buffers, sample data)
- **Message Passing**: UI ↔ Agents for user interactions

**Process Architecture Options**:

**Option A: Separate Process (Recommended)**
```
MAGDA Process:
├── Real-time Audio Thread
├── UI Thread
└── Audio Engine Components

MAGDA Agent Process:
├── Agent Orchestrator
├── Individual Agent Threads
├── ML Model Inference
└── External API Communications
```

**Benefits**:
- **Complete Isolation**: Agent crashes don't affect audio
- **Resource Control**: Can limit agent memory/CPU usage
- **Scalability**: Can run agents on different machines
- **Security**: Agent process can have restricted permissions

**Option B: Thread Pool (Alternative)**
```
Single MAGDA Process:
├── Real-time Audio Thread (isolated)
├── UI Thread
├── Agent Thread Pool
│   ├── Agent Worker 1
│   ├── Agent Worker 2
│   └── Agent Worker N
└── Background Thread Pool
```

**Benefits**:
- **Lower Latency**: No IPC overhead
- **Simpler Deployment**: Single executable
- **Easier Debugging**: All in one process

**Communication Protocols**:

**Audio → Agents (Commands)**:
```cpp
struct AgentCommand {
    CommandType type;
    Timestamp audio_time;
    TargetTrack track_id;
    Parameters params;
    CallbackID callback_id;
};
```

**Agents → Audio (Results)**:
```cpp
struct AgentResult {
    CallbackID callback_id;
    ResultType type;
    AudioData audio_data;     // For DSP results
    ProjectChanges changes;   // For project modifications
    ErrorInfo error;          // If operation failed
};
```

**Performance Guarantees**:
- **Audio Thread**: Never blocked by agent operations
- **Latency Bounds**: Agent responses within 100ms for UI updates
- **Resource Limits**: Agents limited to specific CPU/memory quotas
- **Graceful Degradation**: Audio continues even if agents crash/hang

**Agent Lifecycle Management**:
- **Lazy Loading**: Agents start on first use
- **Auto-restart**: Crashed agents automatically restart
- **Health Monitoring**: System monitors agent responsiveness
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of stuck operations

### 9. Project Version Control & Creative Branching

#### Concept
**Philosophy**: Musicians need version control designed for creative workflows, not code - track creative evolution and enable fearless experimentation

#### Core Version Control Features

**Project Snapshots**:
- **Named Versions**: "Verse 1 Draft", "Final Mix v3", "Alternative Chorus Idea"
- **Automatic Snapshots**: Auto-save at significant points (before major changes, daily, before mixdown)
- **Semantic Versioning**: Major.Minor.Patch format adapted for music (Album.Song.Take)
- **Rich Metadata**: Timestamp, description, audio preview, visual thumbnail

**Creative Branching**:
- **Arrangement Branches**: Try different song structures without losing original
- **Mix Branches**: Experiment with different mixing approaches
- **Instrumentation Branches**: Test different instrument combinations
- **Tempo/Key Branches**: Explore different musical variations

**Asset Management**:
- **Smart Audio Handling**: Only store diffs for audio files, not full copies
- **Reference System**: Link to shared sample libraries instead of duplicating
- **Compression**: Lossless compression for project data, configurable for audio
- **Deduplication**: Automatic detection and sharing of identical audio segments

#### Integration with Track History System

**Unified Versioning**:
```
Project Level:
├── Major Version (Complete song iterations)
│   ├── Track Level History (bounce operations, plugin changes)
│   ├── Arrangement Changes (structure modifications)
│   └── Mix Snapshots (parameter automation states)

Version Tree Example:
Main Project
├── v1.0.0 - "Initial Demo"
├── v1.1.0 - "Added Drums"
├── v1.2.0 - "Vocal Recording"
├── v2.0.0 - "Complete Restructure"
│   ├── v2.1.0 - "Alternative Chorus" (branch)
│   └── v2.2.0 - "Extended Outro" (branch)
└── v3.0.0 - "Final Mix" (merged from v2.1.0)
```

**Cross-Level Integration**:
- **Track History → Project Versions**: Major track changes trigger version prompts
- **Project Versions → Track History**: Reverting versions restores all track states
- **Selective Reversion**: "Keep current drums but revert to old bassline"

#### Advanced Version Control Features

**Visual Comparison Tools**:
- **Waveform Diff**: Visual comparison of audio regions between versions
- **Arrangement Timeline**: Side-by-side comparison of project structures
- **Parameter Diff**: Show automation and plugin parameter changes
- **Spectrum Analysis**: Frequency content comparison between mix versions

**Intelligent Merging**:
- **Track-Level Merging**: Combine changes from different branches at track level
- **Automation Merging**: Blend automation curves from different versions
- **Arrangement Splicing**: Take verses from one version, chorus from another
- **Smart Conflict Resolution**: AI-assisted resolution of conflicting changes

**Collaboration Features**:
- **Branch Permissions**: Control who can modify which branches
- **Change Attribution**: Track which collaborator made which changes
- **Review System**: Approve/reject changes before merging
- **Comment System**: Attach notes and feedback to specific versions

#### Version Control Agent Integration

**Version Control Agent Capabilities**:
- **Smart Versioning**: Automatically suggest when to create versions
- **Branch Recommendations**: "This seems like a good time to branch for experimentation"
- **Merge Assistance**: Help resolve conflicts when combining versions
- **Change Analysis**: "This version has 23% more energy in the chorus"
- **Collaboration Coordination**: Manage multi-user workflows

**Integration with Other Agents**:
- **Composition Agent**: "Let's try this melody in a new branch"
- **Mixing Agent**: "Save current mix as branch before trying these changes"
- **DSP Agent**: "Version this before applying experimental processing"

#### Technical Implementation

**Storage Strategy**:
```
Project Repository Structure:
├── .magda/
│   ├── versions.db          # Version metadata and tree
│   ├── objects/             # Deduplicated project components
│   │   ├── audio/          # Audio file chunks and diffs
│   │   ├── automation/     # Parameter automation data
│   │   └── structure/      # Project structure snapshots
│   ├── refs/               # Branch and tag references
│   └── hooks/              # Custom version control triggers
├── current.project         # Working copy
└── assets/                 # Shared audio resources
```

**Efficient Storage**:
- **Delta Compression**: Only store differences between versions
- **Block-Level Deduplication**: Shared audio chunks across versions
- **Lazy Loading**: Load version data on-demand
- **Background Compression**: Optimize storage during idle time

**Performance Considerations**:
- **Fast Switching**: Version changes in <2 seconds
- **Background Operations**: Version creation doesn't block audio
- **Incremental Sync**: Only sync changed components
- **Local Cache**: Frequently accessed versions cached locally

#### User Experience Design

**Seamless Integration**:
- **Version Timeline**: Visual representation of project evolution
- **Quick Branch**: One-click branching for experimentation
- **Version Player**: Preview any version without switching
- **Smart Suggestions**: Context-aware versioning recommendations

**Workflow Integration**:
- **Save vs Version**: Clear distinction between saves and version creation
- **Undo vs Revert**: Undo for recent changes, revert for version switching
- **Branch Visualization**: Clear visual tree of project evolution
- **Progress Tracking**: See how project has evolved over time

### 10. Open Sequencer API (Reaper-style)

#### Concept
**Philosophy**: Completely open and programmable sequencer like Reaper's scripting system

**Core API Features**:
- **Full Project Access**: Read/write access to all project elements
- **Real-time Modification**: Change project during playback
- **Multi-language Support**: Python, JavaScript, Lua scripting
- **Custom Actions**: User-defined functions accessible via shortcuts

```
- Project properties (tempo, time signature, sample rate)
- Track management (create, delete, reorder)
- Routing configuration
- Master section control
```

**Track Level**:
```
- Clip manipulation (create, move, resize, split)
- Plugin management (insert, remove, configure)
- Automation data access
- Track state management
```

**Real-time Control**:
```
- Transport control (play, stop, record, seek)
- Parameter automation
- MIDI generation and manipulation
- Audio routing changes
```

#### Integration with Multi-Agent System
**Agent-Script Bridge**:
- **Script Generation**: Agents can generate and execute API scripts
- **Workflow Automation**: Common tasks automated via agent-generated scripts
- **Custom Tools**: Users can create agent-assisted custom tools
- **Macro Recording**: Record user actions and convert to reusable scripts

**Example Use Cases**:
- Batch processing operations
- Custom mixing workflows
- Algorithmic composition tools
- Project analysis and statistics
- Custom export/import formats

### 11. MAGICA DSL (Domain-Specific Language)

#### Concept
**Philosophy**: A unified query/command language for both AI agents and power users.

The DSL uses a **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)** approach where:
- **LLM agents** generate DSL scripts (constrained by grammar, no hallucination)
- **Power users** type DSL commands directly for quick automation
- **Runtime** executes scripts with full context access (the LLM doesn't need to see all clips/tracks)

This separates "what to do" (DSL script) from "how to do it" (runtime with full DAW state).

#### Why CFG-Based DSL?

**Traditional LLM approach (context-heavy)**:
```
User: "Find clips shorter than 1 second"
→ LLM receives: [clip1: 0.5s, clip2: 2.3s, clip3: 0.8s, ...] (huge context)
→ LLM reasons about each clip
→ LLM outputs: specific clip IDs
```

**MAGICA DSL approach (context-free)**:
```
User: "Find clips shorter than 1 second"
→ LLM generates DSL: clips().filter(duration_lt=1.0).select()
→ Runtime executes with full Tracktion Edit access
→ Runtime returns: [clip1, clip3]
```

**Benefits**:
- LLM doesn't need DAW state context - just generates the query/script
- Grammar constrains output - no hallucinated commands
- Deterministic execution - same script always produces same result
- Scalable - works whether you have 10 clips or 10,000
- Learnable - users can read AI-generated scripts and learn the DSL

#### DSL Syntax Examples

**Query Operations**:
```
# Find and manipulate clips
clips().filter(track="Piano", duration_lt=1.0).delete()
clips().filter(muted=true).unmute()
clips().in_selection().quantize(grid=0.25)

# Track operations
tracks().filter(has_midi=true).arm()
tracks().filter(name_contains="Vocal").solo()

# Automation
automation().on(track="Bass", param="volume").smooth(window=0.1)
automation().on(track="Synth", param="filter_cutoff").randomize(amount=0.2)
```

**MIDI Operations**:
```
midi().in_clip("Piano_01").transpose(semitones=12)
midi().in_selection().quantize(grid=0.125, strength=0.8)
midi().filter(velocity_lt=20).delete()
midi().filter(note=60).set(velocity=100)
```

**Batch Operations**:
```
# Process all clips on drum tracks
tracks().filter(name_contains="Drum").clips().normalize()

# Find overlapping clips
clips().filter(overlapping=true).list()

# Export stems
tracks().filter(type="audio").each(t => t.export(path="/stems/{name}.wav"))
```

#### Dual-Use Interface

| Use Case | Input | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **AI Agent** | Natural language → LLM → DSL | "Delete short clips" → `clips().filter(duration_lt=0.1).delete()` |
| **Power User** | Direct DSL typing | User types `clips().filter(duration_lt=0.1).delete()` |
| **Macro Recording** | Actions → DSL script | Record actions, export as reusable script |
| **Script Files** | Load .magda scripts | `magda run cleanup.magda` |

#### User Interface

**Command Palette** (Cmd+Shift+P):
- Quick one-liner execution
- Autocomplete with grammar awareness
- Recent command history

**Console Panel**:
- Full REPL with multi-line support
- Syntax highlighting
- Output display with clickable results
- History navigation

**Script Editor**:
- Multi-line script editing
- Syntax highlighting and validation
- Run selection or full script
- Save/load .magda script files

#### C++ Implementation

**Core Components**:

```cpp
// AST Types
struct Value {
    enum Kind { Number, String, Identifier, Bool, Function };
    Kind kind;
    double num;
    std::string str;
    bool boolean;
};

struct Arg { std::string name; Value value; };
struct Call { std::string name; std::vector<Arg> args; };
struct CallChain { std::vector<Call> calls; };

// Engine with method registration (no reflection in C++)
class DSLEngine {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, MethodHandler> methods;
public:
    void registerMethod(const std::string& name, MethodHandler handler);
    Result execute(const std::string& dslCode);
    std::string exportCFG();  // Export grammar for LLM tools
};

// DSL Implementation with Tracktion access
class MAGDADSL {
    tracktion::Edit& edit;  // Direct access to DAW state
public:
    void registerAll(DSLEngine& engine);

    // Query methods
    Result clips(const Args& args);
    Result tracks(const Args& args);
    Result midi(const Args& args);

    // Filter/transform methods
    Result filter(const Args& args);
    Result select(const Args& args);

    // Action methods
    Result delete_(const Args& args);
    Result quantize(const Args& args);
    Result transpose(const Args& args);
};
```

**Parser Options**:
- Hand-written recursive descent (simple, no dependencies)
- PEGTL (header-only PEG parser for C++)
- lexy (modern C++ parser combinator)

#### CFG Export for LLM Tools

The engine exports grammar in formats compatible with LLM structured generation:

```cpp
// Export for OpenAI CFG-constrained generation
std::string cfg = engine.exportCFG();

// Returns Lark-format grammar:
// start: call_chain
// call_chain: call ("." call)*
// call: IDENTIFIER "(" arguments? ")"
// arguments: argument ("," argument)*
// ...
```

This allows LLMs to generate only valid DSL code, eliminating syntax errors and hallucinated commands.

#### Integration with Voice Commands

Voice commands can generate DSL:
```
Voice: "Select all clips shorter than half a beat"
→ STT: "select all clips shorter than half a beat"
→ LLM: clips().filter(duration_lt=0.5).select()
→ Runtime: Executes with full context
→ UI: Updates selection

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Track History System
```
Track State = {
    content: [clips...],
    plugins: [effect_chain...],
    dsp_scripts: [custom_processors...],
    bounce_history: [
        {timestamp, operation, source_state, result_state},
        ...
    ],
    current_version: version_id
}
```

### DSP Language Architecture
```
DSP Pipeline:
Source Code → Parser → AST → Optimizer → Code Generator → Native Code
                                    ↓
                           Real-time Hot-swap System
```

### Mode-Specific Optimization
```
Engine Modes:
- ARRANGEMENT: {
    buffer_size: 1024,
    latency_compensation: true,
    bg_processing: true,
    dsp_optimization: "throughput"
  }
- LIVE: {
    buffer_size: 64,
    latency_compensation: false,
    bg_processing: false,
    dsp_optimization: "latency"
  }
```
